# time_seriers_with_R
Notes in book form for time series STAT 4840.

There is now really only one proper way to make this book, unfortunately. You need to run `make html` from within the `sed_test` directory. To make the solutions, run `make solutions` also from within the `sed_test` directory. The output will be in the main project directory under `_book` or `_solutions`.
